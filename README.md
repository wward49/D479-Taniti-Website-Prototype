Performance Assessment for D479 Website Prototype. 
A basic Prototype of a website for the imaginary island 'Taniti'. Used JavaScript+React with vite. Router starts on "Home Page" with some buttons that are set up to go to a "Section Page" that dynamically changes depending on what button is selected. Section Buttons are their own react components and new buttons for future sections can easily be added. JSON file with section content is imported, parsed, then displayed. A Booking button takes you to a booking page for a dummy form. 

Main Files/Folders Created:

App.jsx, SectionButton.jsx, BookingButton.jsx, ImageScroller.jsx.
